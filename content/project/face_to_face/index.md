Researchers from the Department for Developmental Psychology are interested in how children interact with each other on playgrounds. I have the opportunity to work with the group and am currently developing a method to discover subgroups of children and describe how those groups change over the course of a recess break. 
For this research project, I have the access to face-to-face interaction data collected with RFID tags. The data are hence temporal networks, that give us per second information on which children are close to each other.
I presented a first result at IC2S2.
