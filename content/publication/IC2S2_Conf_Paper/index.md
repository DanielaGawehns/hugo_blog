abstract: Face-to-face interactions can be represented as a changing network over time (i.e., a temporalnetwork), where individuals are represented by nodes and contact moments by edges. A node’s behavior is easily summarized by aggregates such as averages or counts. While such aggregates over time or across nodes are easily calculated statistics, we will loose information on the local level to afford a summary on a global level.   Pattern mining methods,  such as the one that we propose, can extract relevant local structures from data without losing the granularity of the given dataset.  Furthermore, these local structures can be used to give the user an easily interpretable summary of the data.
