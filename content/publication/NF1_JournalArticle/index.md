abstract: We investigated cognitive variability and assessed thecontribution of genetic factors by performing a retrospective cohortstudy and a monozygotic twin case series. We included data of 497children with genetically confirmed NF1 and an IQ assessment,including 12 monozygotic twin and 17 sibling sets.
